# there aren't any issues regarding character sets, but we need to ensure
# that binary data is preserved.  In Python 2, this happens naturally with
# "strings" and the 'str' and 'bytes' types are synonyms.  But in Python 3,
# these are distinct types (with 'str' being based on Unicode), and conversions
# are encoding-sensitive.  The most straightforward encoding to use in this
# context is 'latin-1' (a.k.a.'iso-8859-1'), which directly maps all 256
# 8-bit character values to Unicode page 0.  Thus, if we can enforce the use
# of 'latin-1' encoding, we can preserve arbitrary binary data while correctly
# mapping any actual text to the proper characters.
